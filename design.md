## Visual Effects & Animations

### Core Libraries Used
1. **Anime.js** - Smooth micro-interactions and progress animations
2. **ECharts.js** - Interactive data visualizations and progress charts
3. **p5.js** - Creative coding for background effects and visualizations
4. **Pixi.js** - High-performance graphics for AI visualizations
5. **Typed.js** - Typewriter effects for headings and key messages
6. **Splitting.js** - Text animation effects for emphasis
7. **Splide.js** - Smooth carousels for content navigation
8. **Matter.js** - Physics-based animations for interactive elements
